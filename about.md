#### Self-Introduction
Hey, My name is Ruogu Yang(杨若谷), an incoming Phd student at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. My advisor is Professor [Ziming Zhao](https://zzm7000.github.io/). I received my B.Eng. degree from Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). You can call me `Blue` (小蓝 in Chinese) — I chose this nickname because it’s my favorite WeChat sticker. My slightly more formal English name is `Tony`.
I love music! My favorite band is Mayday (五月天), and my favorite singer is Gloria (邓紫棋).

The best way to reach me is by email at `ruoguyang26@gmail.com`. You are welcome to contact me not only about research, but also regarding my applications, hobbies, and other topics. 
#### Detailed Research Interests

#### Hobbies
**Rowing**
I used to be the captain of the rowing team at SUSTech. I spend most of my spare time rowing, usually training on the rowing machine twice a week and on the water once a week. I row in the 5-seat of the men's eight, and I also row in sculls. Rowing has allowed me to meet many like-minded teammates, all working together toward a common goal. It not only strengthens my physique, but also helps me enter a state of flow and improves my focus when I train in single sculls.
**Classical music**
I enjoy listening to classical music while conducting research, and I also love visiting symphony halls to fully experience it. I have a deep appreciation for classical music across many periods. From the Baroque era, I especially enjoy Bach’s Goldberg Variations; from the Classical period, Beethoven and Mozart; from the Romantic era, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Bruckner, and Schubert; and from the post-Romantic/early 20th-century period, Mahler and Richard Strauss. Exploring music from these diverse periods not only enriches my research time and helps me focus, but also inspires me creatively.
**Powerlifting**
I have been training for about 2.5 years. My personal bests are: Squat 160 kg, Bench Press 110 kg, and Deadlift 195 kg. I had to pause my training since Fall 2025 due to the application season, but I am now gradually getting back into it.
**Surfing**
Surfing is a sport I have always wanted to spend more time training. Unfortunately, during my undergraduate years, it was difficult to access the ocean, so I’ve surfed fewer than ten times so far. I hope to find more opportunities to surf in Boston in the future.
