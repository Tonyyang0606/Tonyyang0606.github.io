#### Self-Introduction
Hey, My name is Ruogu Yang(杨若谷), an incoming Phd student at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University. My advisor is [Ziming Zhao](https://zzm7000.github.io/). I received my B.Eng. degree from Southern University of Science and Technology. You can call me `Blue` (小蓝 in Chinese) — I chose this nickname because it’s my favorite WeChat sticker. My slightly more formal English name is `Tony`.

The best way to reach me is by email at `ruoguyang26@gmail.com`. You are welcome to contact me not only about research, but also regarding my applications, hobbies, and other topics.
